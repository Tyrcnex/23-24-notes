# I need notes!

Hello! If you're here, you probably missed some notes in your pre chem class, or couldn't follow up with the calculations.

This repository is a collection of my notes that will update throughout the year, so if you just couldn't jot down that formula your chem teacher was writing, you can hop into the chemistry repository to find what you're looking for.

## Alright, how do I find the notes?

Go to the [course-notes](https://github.com/Tyrcnex/23-24-notes/tree/main/course-notes) folder and find the notes on the subject you need. Generally, the folders will have an "assignments" and "notes" section. Click into the notes section to get my notes. Some of them have a date, some of them don't.

I'm open for suggestions on how to organize this repository to help people out.

Let's have a fun year, guys!
