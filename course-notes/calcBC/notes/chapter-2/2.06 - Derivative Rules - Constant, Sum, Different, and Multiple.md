## Key Takeaways

- There are three new differentiation rules:
    - Constant rule: This states that, for some constant c, $$\frac{d}{dx}c=0$$
        - Proof:
                - 
    - Constant multiple rule: This states that, for some constant c and function $f(x)$, $$\frac{d}{dx}\left(c\cdot f(x)\right)=c\cdot f'(x)$$
    - Sum and difference rules: This states that, for some two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, $$\frac{d}{dx}\left(f(x)\pm g(x)\right)=f'(x)\pm g'(x)$$
    - The equation of a line tangent to a graph $f(x)$ at $x=c$ is $$y-f(c)=f'(c)(x-c)$$
