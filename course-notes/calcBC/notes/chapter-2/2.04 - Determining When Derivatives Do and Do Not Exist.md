## Raw Notes

- According to the definition of the derivative: $$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
	- Therefore, a function is differentiable at a point $(c,f(c))$, if the function is continuous at that point, and the following equality exists: $$\lim_{h\to0^-}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
	- Informally speaking (ignoring continuity for now because we've already covered that), if you zoom in to that point and it smoothes into a straight line, then it is differentiable at that point (and the derivative is the slope of that straight line)
- So, if a function is differentiable at a point, the function must be continuous at that point
	- The converse is not necessarily true. For example, $|x|$ is continuous at $x=0$, but the derivative from the left is $-1$ and $1$ from the right. Therefore, the derivative does not exist. (this behavior is informally called a corner)
		- There is an additional way a "corner" can exist. Try graphing $\sqrt{|x|}$. This is called a cusp.
	- In addition, take the function $\sqrt[3]{x}$. At $x=0$, the derivative approaches $\infty$, so the derivative does not exist there.

## Key Takeaways

- The derivative does not exist at:
	- Points of discontinuity
	- Continuous points where the derivatives from the left and right are not equal (corners and cusps)
	- Continuous points where the function has a vertical tangent.
