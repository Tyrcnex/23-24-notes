## Raw Notes

- In Unit 2.01 we found that the instantaneous rate of change at a point equals $$\lim _{h\to 0}\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x\right)}{h}$$
	- This is the *derivative* of $f(x)$. There are many ways to represent derivatives. If $y=f(x)$, here is some notation for the derivative of $f(x)$:
		- $f'(x)$ or if you're only using $x$, sometimes it is acceptable to write $f'$.
		- $y'$
		- $\frac{dy}{dx}$: $dy$ represents an infinitesimal change in y and $dx$ represents an infinitesimal change in x. When we *differentiate*, the variable that we are differentiating with respect to is the variable in the denominator, $x$.
		- $\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$: the explanation for the notation is kind of shaky, but imagine turning the y in $\frac{dy}{dx}$ into $f(x)$ and moving it beside the fraction.
- The derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=c$ represents the slope of the tangent line to the point $(c,f(c))$.
- Horizontal tangents (aka points of local minima or maxima) occur on the graph of a function when the derivative equals 0.
- You *could* use the limit notation for evaluating derivatives, but shortcuts for derivatives will be introduced in later chapters.
- Note: If the question shows you a tangent line equation of the point $(c,f(c))$ in the form $y=ax+b$ and tells you to find the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, the derivative is just $a$, because that's the *slope* of the tangent line.

## Key Takeaways

There are four ways that are arguably better and less clunky than the difference quotient. They are $f'(x)/f'$, $y'$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$, or $\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$.
