Q. The graph of $f(x)$ is above. It is known that $g(0)=3.1$ and $f(g(x))=\arctan(1-x)$. Find $g'(0)$.

A. Differentiate both sides of $f(g(x))=\arctan(1-x)$:

$$f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)=-\frac{1}{1+(1-x)^2}$$
Plug in $x=0$ and solve for $g'(0)$:

$$f'(g(0))\cdot g'(0)=-\frac{1}{1+1^2}\Rightarrow g'(0)=-\frac{1}{2f'(g(0))}=-\frac{1}{2f'(3.1)}$$

We now note that in the graph of $f(x)$, at $x=3.1$, it's probably on that second line segment, which has a slope of $-2$, so $f'(3.1)$ is probably $-2$. Plug that in and solve: $$-\frac{1}{2(-2)}=\frac{1}{4}$$
Therefore, $g'(0)=\frac{1}{4}$.
