## Raw Notes

- It is important to recognize when to use what differentiation rule.
- If there is a function in the form $f(x)g(x)$, use the product rule.
    - Note that if $f(x)$ is a constant $c$, you don't need the product rule, you can just differentiate as $cg'(x)$.
- If there is a function in the form $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, use the quotient rule.
- If there is a function in the form $f(g(x))$, use the chain rule.
    - It is important not to confuse this with the product rule. Some students may mistake this for $f(x)g(x)$.
- It is important to recognize that, no matter how weird a term looks, if it doesn't have any $x$ term in it, it is a constant, and the derivative is 0. For example, differentiating $x+e^{\sin(1)+\pi}$ looks scary, but you can realize that the exponential term is just a constant (no $x$), and the derivative of that is 0, and the derivative of $x$ is 1. Therefore, the derivative of that scary looking equation is just $1+0=1$.
- It is also sometimes possible to use basic derivative rules even though a function may look like it requires a differentiation rule. For example, to differentiate $\sec x\sin x$, it might seem like you'd need the product rule, but with a little trig simplification, you'll find that the function is just $\tan x$ in disguise, which can be differentiated using regular derivative rules.
