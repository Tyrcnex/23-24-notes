## Raw Notes

- There are some functions that can be differentiated without the chain rule. For example, functions like $x^2+1$ or $\sin x$ are trivial equations that do not need to use the chain rule. However, some functions like $\sin 6x$ do require the chain rule. Let's see what the chain rule is:
- The chain rule is as follows: $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}$$
- This isn't very understandable in this form. In other notation, it helps us differentiate a function in the form $f(x)=g(h(x))$. In the first equation, $u$ represents $g(x)$. Therefore, we can write it in probably more digestible notation as follows: $$y'=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=g'(h(x))\cdot h'(x)$$
- We can use this to evaluate something like $\sin 6x$. Let $h(x)=6x$, and $g(u)=\sin u$. Then, we solve: $$\sin'(6x)\cdot 6=6\cos6x$$
- This formula is very useful in AP questions, and you need to know how to plug in the values that they give you to answer a question. For example, let's say you're given a function $A(x)=f(g(x))$ and you're given a table of values of values of $f(x)$, $g(x)$, $f'(x)$, and $g'(x)$. Well, let's say $f'(3)=2$, $g(4)=3$, and $g'(4)=10$. If you were asked to find $A'(4)$, you would solve $f'(g(4))\cdot g'(4)$. You would just plug in values and get $10f'(3)=20$.
- You can also use the chain rule multiple times. For example, to integrate $\sin ^26x$:
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}\sin ^26x=\frac{d}{dx}\left[\left(\sin 6x\right)^2\right]$$
    - Set $u=\sin 6x,\ u'=\frac{d}{dx}\sin 6x,f\left(u\right)=u^2,f'\left(u\right)=2u$. $$f'\left(u\right)\cdot u'=2\sin 6x\cdot \frac{d}{dx}\sin 6x$$
    - Set $u=6x,\ u'=6,\ f(u)=\sin u,\ f'(u)=\cos u$ $$\Rightarrow 2\sin 6x\cdot\cos 6x\cdot6=12\sin 6x \cos 6x$$

## Key Takeaways
