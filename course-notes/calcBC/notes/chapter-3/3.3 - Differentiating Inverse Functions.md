## Raw Notes

- Inverse function definition: A function $g$ is the inverse of $f$ if whenever $y=f(x)$ then $x=g(y)$
- Graphically, the graphs of the two inverse functions are symmetrical with respect to the line $y=x$.
- To solve for the derivative of an inverse function of $f$:
    - The first method is to just find the inverse of $f$ and differentiate that. For example, if we wanted to differentiate the inverse of $x^2$ for $x>0$, we would note that the inverse is $\sqrt x$ for $y>0$, so we differentiate and get $\frac{1}{2\sqrt x}$. This method isn't always practical in calculus, though. It's difficult to find the inverse function in some cases.
    - The second method is to replace all $x$'s and $y$'s with $y$'s and $x$'s respectively, and implicitly differentiate and solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Differentiating the inverse of $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x^3-x+3$ yields the following: $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}y^2-1}$$
    - The third method is the one that is the most useful. It is actually derived from the second method. If you look very carefully, you'll realize that in the previous example, the derivative of the inverse function is the inverse of the derivative of $f(x)$, with the variables switched. This means that this is the derivative of an inverse function: $$\left(f^{-1}\right)'(x)=\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}\text{ when }f'(f^{-1}(x))\neq0$$
