Date: **CHANGE THIS**

## Raw Notes

- A function is **increasing** when $f'(x)>0$. A function is **decreasing** when $f'(x)<0$.
- We can actually notice something. A differentiable function is either only increasing or only decreasing between two values where $f'(x)=0$. This means we can determine intervals where it is increasing/decreasing by identifying the solutions to $f'(x)=0$ and then making intervals.
