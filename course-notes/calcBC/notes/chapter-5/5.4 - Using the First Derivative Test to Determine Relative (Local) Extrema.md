## Raw Notes

- Sometimes on the exam the function of $f'$ will be given to you. Then, you can now determine the intervals on which $f$ is increasing or decreasing and consequently determine local maxima and minima.
- The informal way: sign graphs
    - First you find all the zeroes of $f'$. For example, if $f'(x)=3(x-2)(x+5)^2$, you can determine that the zeroes of $f'$ is $x=2$ and $x=-5$. Using a sign graph, we can determine that, to the left of $-5$, $f'$ is negative, on $(-5,2)$, $f'$ is ALSO negative, and to the right of $-2$, $f'$ is positive. Therefore we can conclude the following:
        - At $x=-5$, the derivative does not change sign (it stays negative), so it is neither a maximum or a minimum.
        - At $x=2$, the derivative changes sign (it goes from negative to positive), so it is a minimum.
