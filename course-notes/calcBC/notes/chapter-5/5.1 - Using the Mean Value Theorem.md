## Raw Notes

- The Mean Value Theorem states that, for some function $f(x)$ that is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, there exists at least one number $c$ on the open interval $(a,b)$ such that the instantaneous rate of change at $c$ equals the average rate of change over the interval. In other words: $$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
- Geometric interpretation:

- We can see here that there is a point $(c,f(c))$ such that it has the same slope as the secant line connecting $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$.
- Note that this is an *existence theorem*. This means that the theorem doesn't tell us how to find that point $(c,f(c))$, it just tells us that it *exists*.
- Note that it's possible for multiple $c$ values to exist. For example:

- Here is an example problem. What does the Mean Value Theorem say about $f(x)=x^2-6x+12$ on the interval $[2,6]$?
    - Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable everywhere, including on the interval $[2,6]$. Therefore, the MVT concludes that there is at least one point $c$,  $2<c<6$, where $$f'(c)=\frac{f(6)-f(2)}{6-2}=\frac{12-4}{4}=2$$
- Now let's see why it has to be continuous and differentiable. 
    - Continuity:
        - Consider the sign function, which is not continuous at $x=0$. We know that it has a slope of 0 everywhere except at $x=0$. The average rate of change on the interval $[-1,1]$ is $$\frac{\mathrm{sign}(1)-\mathrm{sign}(-1)}{1-(-1)}=1$$
        - However, we KNOW that the slope is always 0, and it is never equals to 1.
    - Differentiability:
        - Consider the absolute value function. It is continuous everywhere but non-differentiable at $x=0$. It has a slope of $-1$ for $x<0$ and a slope of $1$ for $x>0$. The average rate of change on the interval $[-1,1]$ is $$\frac{|1|-|-1|}{1-(-1)}=0$$
        - However, the slope is never 0.
