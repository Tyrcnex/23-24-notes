## Raw Notes

- Let's say you have a function $f(x)$. It is purposely mysterious, except for the information that it is between $y=1$ and $y=6$ for all values. Well, for any value $c$, we then know the following: $$1\leq\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\leq6$$
- What if it was between $y=4$ and $y=4.1$? Well, then we'd know the following: $$4\leq\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\leq4.1$$
- What if it was between $y=6-x$ and $y=2$? Well, then we'd know the following: $$6-c\leq\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\leq2 \text{ (might have to flip some signs)}$$
	- In this scenario, we'd be able to find the limit if $c=4$, because the equality becomes this: $$2\leq\lim_{x\to 4}f(x)\leq2$$
	- Since there is only one value possible for the limit, the limit must equal to 2.
	- This is the basis of the Squeeze Theorem
- The Squeeze theorem, formally stated: If $g(x)\leq f(x)\leq h(x)$ for all values of $x$ in an open interval containing $c$, except possibly at $c$ itself, and if $\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=L=\lim_{x\to c}h(x)$, then $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)$ exists and equals $L$.
- For example, let's say you have $g(x)=-9-\left|x+3\right|$ and $h(x)=x^2+6x$. Then, given an arbitrary function $f(x)$ that satisfies $g(x)\leq f(x)\leq h(x)$ for all values of $x$ in $[-5,-3]$, we need to find $\lim_{x\to -3}f(x)$ or show that it cannot be determined.
	- We approach this by solving for $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ and seeing if they are equal: if they are, then we can find $\lim_{x\to -3}f(x)$. Plugging in, we see that $g(-3)=h(-3)=-9$, and so we know that: $$\lim_{x\to-3}f(x)=-9$$

## Key Takeaways

Let's say you have two lines, and that a function $f(x)$ is somewhere between those lines. If there is a gap between the lines, then $f(x)$ could be anywhere between these lines; there are infinite possibilities. However, if there is no gap (i.e. the lines are touching (so cute)), then we can determine the limit of f(x) at that point. 

This is the Squeeze Theorem.

The Squeeze theorem, formally stated: If $g(x)\leq f(x)\leq h(x)$ for all values of $x$ in an open interval containing $c$, except possibly at $c$ itself, and if $\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=L=\lim_{x\to c}h(x)$, then $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)$ exists and equals $L$.
