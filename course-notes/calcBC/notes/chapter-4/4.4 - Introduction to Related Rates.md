## Raw Notes

- Here is an interesting problem: Let $A=\pi r^2$. Find $\frac{dA}{dw}$.
    - Notice that the differentiation variable is $w$, but $w$ is nowhere in the original equation! We solve this with implicit differentiation. The derivative of $A$ with respect to $w$ is $\frac{dA}{dw}$. To solve this problem, we can implicitly differentiate: $$\frac{dA}{dw}=\frac{d}{dw}\left[\pi r^2\right]=\pi\frac{d}{dw}\left[ r^2\right]$$
    - We can now use the chain rule, noting that the derivative of $r$ with respect to $w$ is $\frac{dr}{dw}$. $$\frac{dA}{dw}=\pi\cdot2r\cdot\frac{dr}{dw}=2\pi r\frac{dr}{dw}$$
    - What's interesting is that in the new equation, there are *two* derivatives: $\frac{dA}{dw}$ and $\frac{dr}{dw}$.
- Remember, if the variable you are taking the derivative with respect to is not present, you have to use the chain rule.
- Remember to take the derivative of *both sides* of the equation, and that the derivative of a constant, with respect to any variable, is equal to 0.
- By taking the derivative of an equation with respect to a variable that is not explicitly in the equation, we are finding a relationship between derivatives (rates).
- Now, what's the use of this? How do we use this "new" variable that isn't even in the equation?
- Well, here's the problem: Let's say you have a 25ft ladder propped up against the wall and the bottom part of the ladder is sliding away at a rate of 1ft/sec. Is the top of the ladder falling at the same rate?
- Imagine the following diagram.

- We may be stuck on how to do this problem, but we can try to relate the $x$ and $y$ variables. Here, by the Pythagoras theorem, $x^2+y^2=25^2$. Since the bottom of the ladder is sliding away at a *rate* of 1ft/sec, we know that the derivative should be in the form of feet/sec; hence, we know that the rate of the bottom of the ladder sliding away can be written as $\frac{dx}{dt}$. We can actually *relate* this to the rate that we do want to find: $\frac{dy}{dt}$. Differentiating $x^2+y^2=25$ with respect to $t$ yields this: $$2x\frac{dx}{dt}+2y\frac{dy}{dt}=0\Rightarrow x\frac{dx}{dt}+y\frac{dy}{dt}=0$$
- Let's see how we can use this relation in another example. The radius of a circle is increasing at a rate of 2 inches/minute. Find the rate of increase of the area of the circle when the radius is 4 inches.
    - We are asked to find the *rate of increase* of the *area*, with respect to *time*. We can write an equation relating the *area* and the *radius*, then differentiate with respect to time, like so: $$A=\pi r^2$$
    - Differentiating yields: $$\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi r\frac{dr}{dt}$$
    - Now, we know what $r$ and $\frac{dr}{dt}$ are in this case! $r$ is given to be 4 inches, and $\frac{dr}{dt}$ is 2 inches/minute. Therefore: $$\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi(4\ \text{inches})\left(2\ \frac{\text{inches}}{\text{minute}}\right)=16\pi\frac{\text{inches}^2}{\text{minute}}$$
    - The area of the circle is increasing at a rate of $16\pi$ inches squared per minute!
- So to solve a related rates problem, do the following:
    - Find the different rates in the question.
    - Identify the variable you are differentiating with respect to (usually $t$), as well as the independent and dependent variables.
    - Take the derivative of both sides with respect to $t$ and use the chain rule.
    - After you're done, substitute all values into the equation and add the appropriate units.
