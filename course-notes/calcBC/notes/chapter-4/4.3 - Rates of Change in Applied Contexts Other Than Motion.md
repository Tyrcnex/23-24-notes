Date: **CHANGE THIS**

## Raw Notes

- Derivatives don't have to represent velocity or motion in general. For example, if someone has $100 dollars on September 8th and $200 dollars 4 days later, we say that he earns an average of $25 dollars per day.
- The dependent variable doesn't have to be $y$, and the independent variable doesn't always have to be $x$. For example, let's define a function $W(a)=a^2+3a$, which represents the number of watermelons that are on a farm of size $a$ acres. The rate of change of $W$ can be written as $W'(a)$ or $\frac{dW}{da}$. The units would be the units of $W$ per the units of $a$. So, we could write the derivative with units as $W'(a) \frac{\text{watermelons}}{\text{acre}}$ or $\frac{dW}{da} \frac{\text{watermelons}}{\text{acre}}$.
