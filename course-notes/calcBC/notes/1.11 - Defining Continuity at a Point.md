## Raw Notes

- There are three conditions that must be satisfied for a function to be continuous at a point $(c,f(c))$.
	1. $f(c)$ exists.
	2. $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)$ exists. (check the left and right sided limits)
	3. $f(c)=\lim_{x\to c}f(x)$
- You can determine if a function is continuous at $x=c$ by looking at its graph.
	- To satisfy the first condition, see if a black dot is at $x=c$ (or if the curve goes through but does not have a hole at $x=c$).
	- To satisfy the second condition, check if the function approached from the left is equal to the function approached from the right.
	- To satisfy the third condition, check if the results from the first and second step are equal.
