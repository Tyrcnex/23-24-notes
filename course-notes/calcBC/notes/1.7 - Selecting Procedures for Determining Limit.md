## Raw Notes

- It is important to recognize the procedures for determining a limit.
	- For a rational function, it is best factor the numerator and/or the denominator and see if terms cancel.
	- When a square root is involved, try multiplying by the conjugate.
	- When a piecewise is involved, try looking at one sided limits and see if you can draw any conclusion.
	- When a limit is given, use limit laws to manipulate the unknown limit into the given limit.
	- Sometimes it is also useful to sketch a simple graph.
- It is also important to make connections between different representations of a limit. For example, you might be asked to show that a graph, table, and equation all represent the same limit (or have the same value).
