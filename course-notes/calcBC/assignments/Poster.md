## Vertical asymptote

$f(x)$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=a$ if $$\left|\lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)\right| \text{ or } \left|\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)\right|=\infty$$
In informal terms, if you trace your fingers along the function from both sides approaching this x-value, and at least one finger goes up or down to infinity, that is a vertical asymptote.
## Horizontal asymptote

$f(x)$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y=b$ if $$\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x) \text{ or } \lim_{x\to +\infty}f(x)=b$$
In informal terms, if you trace your fingers towards the right (towards positive infinity) or left (towards negative infinity), and one of the fingers approaches a y-value of $b$, that is a horizontal asymptote.
## Continuity

$f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ if the following properties are satisfied:

1. $f(a)$ is defined
2. $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists
3. $\lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=f(a)$

In informal terms, if you trace your fingers along the function from both sides approaching this x-value, and you reach a point where there's no weird jumps or holes or whatsoever, then it's continuous at that point.
