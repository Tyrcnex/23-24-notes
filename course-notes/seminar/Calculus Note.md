Geometrically, integration can be thought of as the area under a curve. The integral calculates the total area between the curve, x-axis, and bounds of integration.

Physically, integration models the idea of accumulation or toting up small quantities over an interval. It can represent concepts like distance traveled, work done, fluid flowing, electric charge, probability, and more.

Integration is essentially the reverse of the rate of change concept in differentiation. If we know the rate at which something is changing (derivative), integration finds how much of that thing has accumulated over time or distance (antiderivative).

Indefinite integrals represent a function family rather than a single function. Any antiderivative F(x) that satisfies the integral relation F'(x) = f(x) is a valid solution.

Definite integrals eliminate the constant of integration C by evaluating the antiderivative between bounds. This gives a unique numeric result for the precise amount accumulated between two points.

Understanding integration geometrically as area under a curve and physically as accumulation over an interval helps grasp the conceptual meaning beyond just procedures and formulas.

The basic properties of integration include:

∫(f(x) + g(x))dx = ∫f(x)dx + ∫g(x)dx
∫cf(x)dx = c∫f(x)dx, where c is a constant
∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C, where F(x) is an antiderivative and C is the constant of integration
