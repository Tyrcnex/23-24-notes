### Research Question
How can Korean high schools effectively support students in balancing esports involvement with academic demands?
### Primary Argument (thesis)
By creating an esports integrated program that recognizes and supports prominent esports students, schools can assist players in honing effective management and leadership skills and maintaining their academic performance while also providing recognition for esports as a legitimate pursuit.

### Lenses
*Note: As you read your sources, what lenses did you feel the topic was being discussed through?*
The esports source was mainly covering an ethical and scientific lens. The Roosevelt source was covering an ethical lens. The psychological source was covering, well, a psychological/scientific lens. For my claims, I plan to use an ethical and scientific lens, but also a cultural and social lens to examine the reasons behind the rise of esports and the tradition of academic pursuit in Korea.

Esports has become a major interest for many Korean students in recent years. According to a 2022 survey in South Korea of 125 professional esports players, about 33% of them were 19 years old or below. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/829642/south-korea-professional-esports-player-age-distribution/) For these students, playing competitive League of Legends, Call of Duty, or other video games has become an integral part of teenage culture. However, their newfound passion for esports is often at odds with the immense academic pressure placed on them by parents and society. Securing admission into  prestigious universities is seen as essential for acquiring a high-paying, stable career. As a result, Korean students face extreme levels of stress. (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/9/11/187) However, esports has the potential to ease some of this burden. Scholarship opportunities are becoming increasingly available for talented players at both the collegiate and professional level. Strong showings in tournaments can even lead to sponsorships that fund university educations.

At the core of supporting Korean esports students is collaborative effort between schools, players and their parents. To effectively nurture and support promising esports students, schools must devise a comprehensive strategy that successfully balances a student's esports endeavors with their academic progress. By implementing an integrated esports program, schools can empower players to sharpen their management and leadership skills while upholding their academic performance.

> **BONUS POINTS** if you use Signpost Words in this list. Underline or highlight them to make sure you and your editing partner can see them.

- First I will introduce the context of the problem: balancing esports endeavors with stressful academic progress.
- Then, I will look at the problem through a scientific (more specifically psychological) lens, comparing and contrasting the psychological impacts of esports and stressful academics, then examining how a hybrid approach would be beneficial. (I can also talk about the cultural/historical significance of the rise of esports with the traditions surrounding academic achievement.) I will use the psychological stimulus source.
- I will also look at the problem through the ethical lens to support the hybrid approach. I will use the stimulus source "Proper Place for Sports," and I will also use the "Taking College Esports Seriously" stimulus source to talk about the different life skills that students can develop.
- Then, I will discuss the potential obstacles; namely, the lack of recognition and school policies regarding esports. (however I can also talk about schools that HAVE introduced esports programs) I will discuss different viewpoints of school administrators. I will also discuss the viewpoints of esports organizations and how some of them have or have not successfully integrated programs into the educational environment.
- I will then propose three solutions: flexible scheduling, academic support, and an esports-academics integration program.

### First Supportive Claim (Cultural/Social, Ethical)
**CLAIM:** A hybrid educational approach must be adopted to balance esports enthusiasm and academic progress.

> **Bulleted list of ideas/subclaims necessary to establish the claim.**
- Commonly, gaming is associated with negative psychological impacts such as depression, obsession, etc.
- However, esports can be associated with positive psychological factors too, such as sustained attention, planning, working memory, etc. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8188925/, "Some psychological skill involved in esports...")
- Academic stress is associated with many negative effects, including physical, behaviorial, and psychological problems. Students may experience difficulty navigating a social environment and communicating with peers and teachers. These are mainly caused by high amounts of homework and stressful exams. Korea is known for its intense educational systems. (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/9/11/187)
- Though many parents are concerned for their children about getting into prosperous universities and focus much of their efforts on their child's academic progress, esports can also provide opportunities, such as scholarships (Taking College Esports Seriously, show the LoL and DOTA scholarship statistics). To help promising esports players, a hybrid educational approach should be adopted to balance esports enthusiasm and academic progress, to lessen stress and maximize opportunities.
- As Roosevelt wrote in a letter to his children, "I am glad you should play football; I am glad that you should box; I am glad that you should ride and shoot and walk and row as well as you do. I should be very sorry if you did not do these things. But don’t ever get into the frame of mind which regards these things as constituting the end to which all your energies must be devoted, or even the major portion of your energies." OR I could use "I don’t want you to sacrifice standing well in your studies to any over-athleticism; and I need not tell you that character counts for a great deal more than either intellect or body in winning success in life." (Proper Place for Sports). This quote serves to show why a hybrid approach is necessary; esports can be great for a variety of things such as life skill development and improved psychology, but too much devotion to either academics or esports can be detrimental. A healthy medium should be struck.

### Second Supportive Claim (potential obstacles)
**CLAIM:** The hybrid approach should also have some sort of parent influence: esports should be valued alongside academic achievements.

> **Bulleted list of ideas/subclaims necessary to establish the claim.**
- The most prominent obstacle to this adoption are parental and education views on esports. Given the academic expectations of many Korean parents and the academic pressure that schools put on students, it's valid to assume that they would not be entirely supportive of an esports adoption. Therefore in the solutions esports should be valued alongside academic achievements for parents to support their children's progress.

### ~~Third Supportive Claim~~ Solutions
> **Bulleted list of ideas/subclaims necessary to establish the claim.**
1. Flexible scheduling: Schools can implement a flexible scheduling system that allows students involved in esports to have designated schedules for practice and competitions. This could help develop their time-management skills. However, with different workloads in Korean schools, it may prove difficult for teachers and students to find suitable time slots. In addition, this still does not solve the issue of academic workload, as students may have a heavier academic burden. At worst, it may lead to a compromise in their academic performance if they cannot effectively manage their time.
2. Academic Support: Schools can establish tutoring and mentoring programs specifically designed for students involved in esports. These programs can provide academic support, study resources, and guidance tailored to their unique needs. However, there may be limitations on the availability of tutors and mentors specifically trained to support esports students. In addition, it is challenging to align tutoring sessions with competitions and demanding training.

Notice these two solutions do not alter the actual academic burden of Korean students. This is the main reason why both of these solutions are sub-optimal; it is often very complex to manage the schedules.

3. Esports-academics integration program: Schools can create an integrated program that recognizes and supports promising esports students while prioritizing their academic development. This program would solve the main problem of the previous two solutions by actually modifying the curriculum to fit the needs of esports students. It may also serve as a hybrid solution of the previous two solutions, because there could be time management and goal setting workshops as well as academic support in the form of tutoring sessions included in the schedule. This approach also gives players a sense of community and identity. "Participants at Site 1 noted that gamers fought various stigmas associated with committed gaming, such as social isolation, obesity, or the perception of being “That Guy” gamer who is imagined as having the worst characteristics of the hardcore gamer (homophobic, sexist, or antisocial) (Bergstrom, Fisher, & Jenson, 2016). Coming to a school with a collegiate esports program, however, allowed Player 3 to express his satisfaction with being accepted as someone interested in esports. As he stated, "I can be myself around these guys…I wear my jersey around, but before, I wouldn’t. I had a competitive COD jersey; I wouldn’t wear it in public. The day I got my [varsity esports] jersey, I wore that when I went to get food."" (Taking College Esports Seriously) This approach would also provide official recognition for esports as a legitimate pursuit. It is not, of course, without limitations. Resource allocation (for dedicated gaming rooms, high-performance equipment, qualified coaches and instructors, etc) may be difficult depending on obstacles in terms of funding and infrastructure. It may also be challenging to adjust the curriculum. It might also prove challenging to assess the progress and achievements of students involved in esports. Developing appropriate evaluation criteria that recognize skills and accomplishments achieved through esports (like teamwork, strategic thinking, and leadership) is complicated and a subjective process. Ensuring that esports are valued alongside academic achievements are crucial for parents to actively support their children's esports progress.

### Final redress of primary argument
*This is essentially where you wrap up and assert the value of your primary argument of the paper. It is where you will also discuss possible examples of your solution or conclusion.*

In conclusion, the integration of esports and academics presents a unique challenge, but also an opportunity for student development. By considering the psychological and ethical aspects, it becomes evident that a hybrid approach, combining the benefits of both esports and academics, is necessary. Despite the obstacles of recognition and school policies, successful integration is possible, as demonstrated by schools that have embraced esports programs. By implementing these programs, educational institutions can create an environment that nurtures well-rounded individuals and prepares them for success in both esports and academic endeavors.
