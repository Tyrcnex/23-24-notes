> I am not a scholar of English or literature... I am a *writer*.

She establishes her credibility and informs the audience that her personal opinions will be from the perspective of a writer.

 > Recently, I was made keenly aware of the *different Englishes* I use.

In the first paragraph, Tan broadly talks about "English or literature". Here, she implies a probable, more specific topic that she will cover: something related to the "different Englishes", or possible "different" forms of a language.

> ... a speech with carefully wrought nominalized form, past perfect tenses, conditional phrases, all the forms of standard English that I had learned in school and through books, the forms of English *I did not use at home with my mother.*

This sentence has a nice rhetorical effect. She places the main point at the end of a lengthy sentence. In this sentence, she's now describing two different forms of English: namely, that of "proper" (learnt at school and in books) English and the English that Tan uses with her mother/family.

> It has become our language of *intimacy*, a different sort of English that relates to *family talk*, the language I *grew up with*.

When looking at the terms in italics, we see that Tan is arguing that different sorts of English aren't bad; rather, some are even better in different contexts.

> So *you'll* have some idea of what this family talk I heard sounds like...

She's using second person here to connect with the audience.

> You should know that my mother's *expressive command* of English belies how much she actually understands.

I think this is either a euphemism for the strange English that her mother uses, or Tan's idea that this strange English is the true way that her mother expresses herself.

> Her language, as I hear it, is vivid, direct, full of observation and imagery. That was the language that helped shape the way I saw things, expressed things, made sense of the world.

A strong declaration of what Tan believes that her mother's "strange" English is.

> ...when I was growing up, my mother's "limited" English limited my perception of her. I was ashamed of her English. I believed that her English reflected the quality of what she had to say. That is, because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect. I had plenty of empirical evidence to support me: the fact that people in department stores, at banks, and at restaurants did not take her seriously, did not give her good service, pretended to not understand her, or even acted as if they did not hear her.

The use of past tense here shows that Tan at present does not support the idea that a person's English "reflect\[s\] the quality" of that person's ideas.

Though I agree that a person's "limited" expressiveness of a language does not reflect the actual quality of that person's ideas, an unfortunate fact about society is that many people may unconsciously engage in stereotyping. Negative experiences or media portrayals that highlight certain behaviors or attitudes of a group of people (who usually speak with limited expressiveness of a certain language) can lead to the generalization of these characteristics of an entire group.
