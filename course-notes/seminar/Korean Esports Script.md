## INTRODUCTION

Esports has become a major interest for many Korean students in recent years. According to a 2022 survey in South Korea of 125 professional esports players, about 33% of them were 19 years old or below. For these students, playing competitive League of Legends, Call of Duty, or other video games has become an integral part of teenage culture. However, their newfound passion for esports is often at odds with the immense academic pressure placed on them by parents and society. According to sociologists Jarvis et. al, securing admission into prestigious universities is seen as essential for acquiring a high-paying, stable career. As a result, Korean students face extreme levels of stress. However, esports has the potential to ease some of this burden. Scholarship opportunities are becoming increasingly available for talented players at both the collegiate and professional level. Strong showings in tournaments can even lead to sponsorships that fund university educations.

## SOLUTION PREVIEW

At the core of supporting Korean esports students is collaborative effort between schools, players and their parents. To effectively nurture and support promising esports students, schools must devise a comprehensive strategy that successfully balances a student's esports endeavors with their academic progress. By implementing an integrated esports program, schools can empower players to sharpen their management and leadership skills while upholding their academic performance.

## LINE OF REASONING

Commonly, gaming is associated with negative psychological impacts such as depression, obsession, etc.

However, esports can be associated with positive psychological factors too, such as sustained attention, planning, working memory, etc. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8188925/, "Some psychological skill involved in esports...")

Academic stress is associated with many negative effects, including physical, behaviorial, and psychological problems. Students may experience difficulty navigating a social environment and communicating with peers and teachers. These are mainly caused by high amounts of homework and stressful exams. Korea is known for its intense educational systems. (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/9/11/187)

Though many parents are concerned for their children about getting into prosperous universities and focus much of their efforts on their child's academic progress, esports can also provide opportunities, such as scholarships (Taking College Esports Seriously, show the LoL and DOTA scholarship statistics). To help promising esports players, a hybrid educational approach should be adopted to balance esports enthusiasm and academic progress, to lessen stress and maximize opportunities.

As Roosevelt wrote in a letter to his children, "I am glad you should play football; I am glad that you should box; I am glad that you should ride and shoot and walk and row as well as you do. I should be very sorry if you did not do these things. But don’t ever get into the frame of mind which regards these things as constituting the end to which all your energies must be devoted, or even the major portion of your energies." OR I could use "I don’t want you to sacrifice standing well in your studies to any over-athleticism; and I need not tell you that character counts for a great deal more than either intellect or body in winning success in life." (Proper Place for Sports). This quote serves to show why a hybrid approach is necessary; esports can be great for a variety of things such as life skill development and improved psychology, but too much devotion to either academics or esports can be detrimental. A healthy medium should be struck.

The most prominent obstacle to this adoption are parental and education views on esports. Given the academic expectations of many Korean parents and the academic pressure that schools put on students, it's valid to assume that they would not be entirely supportive of an esports adoption. Therefore in the solutions esports should be valued alongside academic achievements for parents to support their children's progress.

## SOLUTION 1

Flexible scheduling: Schools can implement a flexible scheduling system that allows students involved in esports to have designated schedules for practice and competitions. This could help develop their time-management skills. 

Limitations:
- However, with different workloads in Korean schools, it may prove difficult for teachers and students to find suitable time slots. 
- Also, if students need to prioritize their esports involvement, they might need to sacrifice their extracurricular activities which could have been spent in other clubs and community service.
- It may also prove difficult because flexible scheduling may also result in students practicing and competing at different times, which limits opportunities for collaborative training and practice. This could also mean that players would not have consistent practice partners or the opportunity to train as a team. 
- In addition, this still does not solve the issue of academic workload, as students may have a heavier academic burden. At worst, it may lead to a compromise in their academic performance if they cannot effectively manage their time.
- Parents may also still perceive esports as a less than valuable pursuit compared to academic endeavors. This makes it difficult for players to receive recognition for their achievements

## SOLUTION 2

Academic Support: Schools can establish tutoring and mentoring programs specifically designed for students involved in esports. These programs can provide academic support, study resources, and guidance tailored to their unique needs. 

Limitations:
- However, there may be limitations on the availability of tutors and mentors specifically trained to support esports students.
- This approach also would need some curriculum modification, which may be difficult because esports may have different skill and grading requirements compared to traditional academic programs.
- There is also the risk that putting too much emphasis on academics may detract from esports training and development, which was the whole purpose of these solutions. 
- There is still the problem of parent perception of esports. Putting too much emphasis on academics may make parents feel as if esports were a distraction from academic pursuits. This, again, may also influence whether the player’s achievements will be recognized.
- In addition, it is challenging to align tutoring sessions with competitions and demanding training.

So far, we’ve seen two solutions that have some similar problems.
- There’s almost no parent influence whatsoever, and there’s still the negative parent perception of esports
- The solutions still do not alter the academic burden. Solution 1 doesn’t do this at all, while solution 2 merely tries to assist students with academics, it doesn’t actually reduce the burden, i.e. assignments, tests, classes, etc.

## SOLUTION 3

Esports-academics integration program: Schools can create an integrated program that recognizes and supports promising esports students while prioritizing their academic development. 
Implications:
- This program would solve the main problem of the previous two solutions by actually modifying the curriculum to fit the needs of esports students. 
- It may also serve as a hybrid solution of the previous two solutions, because there could be time management and goal setting workshops as well as academic support in the form of tutoring sessions included in the schedule.
- This approach also gives players a sense of community and identity. "Participants at Site 1 noted that gamers fought various stigmas associated with committed gaming, such as social isolation, obesity, or the perception of being “That Guy” gamer who is imagined as having the worst characteristics of the hardcore gamer (homophobic, sexist, or antisocial) (Bergstrom, Fisher, & Jenson, 2016). Coming to a school with a collegiate esports program, however, allowed Player 3 to express his satisfaction with being accepted as someone interested in esports. As he stated, "I can be myself around these guys…I wear my jersey around, but before, I wouldn’t. I had a competitive COD jersey; I wouldn’t wear it in public. The day I got my [varsity esports] jersey, I wore that when I went to get food."" (Taking College Esports Seriously)
- This approach would also provide official recognition for esports as a legitimate pursuit.

Limitations:
- Resource allocation (for dedicated gaming rooms, high-performance equipment, qualified coaches and instructors, etc) may be difficult depending on obstacles in terms of funding and infrastructure.
- It may also be challenging to adjust the curriculum. It might also prove challenging to assess the progress and achievements of students involved in esports. Developing appropriate evaluation criteria that recognize skills and accomplishments achieved through esports (like teamwork, strategic thinking, and leadership) is complicated and a subjective process. 
- Ensuring that esports are valued alongside academic achievements are crucial for parents to actively support their children's esports progress.

## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the integration of esports and academics presents a unique challenge, but also an opportunity for student development. By considering the psychological and ethical aspects, it becomes evident that a hybrid approach, combining the benefits of both esports and academics, is necessary. Despite the obstacles of recognition and school policies, successful integration is possible, as demonstrated by schools that have embraced esports programs. By implementing these programs, educational institutions can create an environment that nurtures well-rounded individuals and prepares them for success in both esports and academic endeavors.
