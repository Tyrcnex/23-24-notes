Atom/Molecule classes

```js
class Atom {
    constructor(symbol, number) {
        if (number < 0) {
            throw new Error('expected positive number, got negative');
        }
        
        // floor number then check if it's falsy, if not default value is 1
        number = Math.floor(number);
        this.number = number || 1;
        this.symbol = symbol;
        getAtomData();
    }
    
    getAtomData() {
        let atom = periodicTable.find(data => data.symbol === this.symbol);
        if (!atom) {
            
        }
    }
    
    
    
}
```

After the outer `parse()` function has been run, check if `tokens` is empty. If it's not, there's an error (such as an extra `)`), and return that error.

Parse plan for `(O2N4C)4Ag2+7H2O+2O` (subject to change)
```js
1 parse nest=1, ['(','O','2','N','4','C',')','4','Ag','2','+','7','H','2','O','+','2','O']
1 let equation: Equation
1 let molecule: Molecule
1 peek '(', is of type LEFTPAREN // use LeftParen.parselet()
1 consume('(')
1 let particle = parse nest=2 ['O','2','N','4','C',')','4','Ag','2','+','7','H','2','O','+','2','O']

    // IMPORTANT NOTE: if nest>1, and a '+' is detected, return immediately.
    // then, on the outside, since it is expecting a ')' but gets '+', it will throw an error.
    // why do this? this is because something like O2(H+C) is not valid chemistry notation (but O2H+CO2 is).
    // 
    // the variable "equation" will still be created, however, because I don't want to modify the entire parse() function to handle this issue.

Question: Should I remove the `length of molecule === 1` check? Reason: `O2` is not the same as `2O` , because the former represents two oxygen atoms bonded together to form a dioxygen molecule, while the latter represents two unbonded oxygen atoms. TODO: ask chem teacher

Adding onto this, will `molecule.addParticle(Atom('O'),2)` turn into `Atom('O',2)` or `Molecule { number: 2, particles: [Atom('O')] }`?
