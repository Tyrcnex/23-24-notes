## Raw Notes

Atomic Structure

- In the center of the atom, there is the nucleus: it is made up of protons and neutrons. The electrons are orbiting the nucleus in an electron cloud. The electron cloud's radius is much larger than that of the nucleus; however, most of the mass is concentrated in the nucleus (99+%). 
- This means that most of the atom is empty space, which means lots of particles, like high energy particles, can go straight through with minor interference.
- Here are the charges of the subatomic particles:
    - Neutrons = 0
    - Protons = +1
    - Electron = -1
- It is a known fact that opposite charges attract: try putting opposite ends of a magnet together. Then, if the protons attract the electrons, why don't the electrons fall right into the nucleus? The answer is the electron's speed. For something to be in orbit, it has to constantly "fall" towards the center, yet move horizontally fast enough that it enters into an orbit. Therefore, it will stay in orbit given the right amount of energy
    - There are times, however, when a particle, like a photon, hits an electron and cause the electron to fly off, turning the atom into an ion. Sometimes, the electron *can* fall into the nucleus, and it's called electron capture. For the most part, though, electrons stay in orbit and the atom stays neutral.
- It is also a known fact that like charges repel, so why don't the protons fly apart from each other in the nucleus? Actually, there is a force called the strong nuclear force that keeps the nucleus together, much stronger than electrostatic force that tries to pull the protons apart.
- The mass of the subatomics are as follows:
    - Proton: $1.6726\times10^{-27}\text{ kg}=1\text{ amu}$
    - Neutron: $1.6749\times10^{-27}\text{ kg}=1\text{ amu}$ (slightly heavier than a proton)
    - Electron: $9.11\times10^{-31}\text{ kg}=0.000549\text{ amu}$
        - This mass is usually neglible
- The net charge is the number of protons - the number of electrons.
- Atoms are electrically neutral (same number of protons and electrons), but ions carry a positive/negative charge (different number of protons and electrons). In any of these, the number of protons and neutrons are not guaranteed to be the same.
