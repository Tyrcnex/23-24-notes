Ion-induced dipole interaction:
If a non-polar molecule gets close to an ion, the atoms in the non-polar molecules will be partially attracted to the ion.
For example, $\ce{H-H}$ is non-polar, but when $\ce{Cl}$ gets close to it, the positive $\ce{H}$ gets partially attracted to the $\ce{Cl}$ ion. This can be interpreted as either the H atom cheating on the other H atom, or as a friendly threesome experience. 

Interaction between water and cations:
Example: In the interaction between $\ce{H_2O}$ and the ion $\ce{Na^+}$, the water molecule will orient to have the oxygen atom facing the ion, like a woman orienting herself in the doggy position. However, the attraction is stronger when the ion is $\ce{Al^{3+}}$ because it is more positive; you can interpret this as the woman's libido increasing as the positivity of the ion increases.
