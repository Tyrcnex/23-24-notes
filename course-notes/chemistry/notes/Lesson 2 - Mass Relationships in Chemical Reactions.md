## Raw Notes

- Micro-world: atoms and molecules ——> Macro-world: grams
- The atomic mass is the mass of an atom in atomic mass units (amu)
	- By definition the most abundant isotope of carbon weighs 12 amu.
- The average atomic mass is the sum of the amu of each isotope (same element with different neutrons) weighted with their rareness in nature.
	- Mathematically, you take each isotope, multiply with the percentage of it in nature, add them all up, and divide the whole thing by 100.
- The mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in exactly 12.00 grams of the most abundant isotope of carbon.
	- 1 mol = $N_A$ = $6.0221367 \times 10^{23}$
		- This number is equivalent to Avogadro’s number.
		- Usually you just use $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ as a reasonable approximation.
		- For example, if you have 1 mol of H2O, you have $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles of H2O.
		- Elementary entities refer to particles, atoms, or ions to that specific substance.
- Molar mass is the mass of 1 mole of \[insert thing here\] in grams.
	- 1 mole of the most abundant isotope = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms = 12.00g.
	- Atomic mass (amu) = mole mass (grams)
- Molecular mass (or molecular weight) is the sum of the atomic masses (in amu) in a molecule
	- For any molecule, the molecular mass in amu = molar mass in grams.
		- For example, 1 molecule of $SO_2$ weighs 64.07 amu, but 1 mole of $SO_2$ weighs 64.07 grams.
		- How many H atoms are in 72.5g of $C_3 H_8 O$?
			- The molecular mass is $3 \times 12.01 + 8 \times 1.0078 + 1 \times 16.00 = 60.0924\text{g}$
			- Then, we write the following: $$72.5\text{g}\ C_3H_8O\left(\frac{1\ \text{mol}\ C_3H_8O}{60.0924\text{g}\ C_3H_8O}\right)\left(\frac{8\ \text{mol}\ H}{1\ \text{mol}\ C_3H_8O}\right)\left(\frac{6.022\times10^{23}\ H\  \text{atom}}{1\ \text{mol of}\ H}\right)$$
			- We can simplify: $$=72.5\left(\frac{8\times6.022\times10^{23}}{60.0924}\right) = 5.82\times10^{24} \ H\ \text{atoms (3 s.f.)}$$
