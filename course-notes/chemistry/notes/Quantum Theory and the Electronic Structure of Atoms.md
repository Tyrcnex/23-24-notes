## Notes

Let's first look at a wave. It looks like a sine curve, with peaks or troughs, though I'm going to refer to them as hills and dips.

There are a few properties of waves.

> **Wavelength** is the distance between identical points on successive waves

You can think of this as the distance between the two closest "hills" of a wave.

> **Amplitude** is the vertical distance from the midline of a wave to the peak or a trough.

You can think of this as the "height" of a hill.

Here is a picture showing wavelength and amplitude. ![wavelength and amplitude](img/waveamp.png "Wavelength and Amplitude")
> **Frequency** is the number of waves that pass through a particular point in 1 second (Hz = 1 cycle/s)

Think about it like this: The wave starts appearing from the left, moving up and and down as it moves to the right. After one second, how many hills are there?

> The **speed** of a wave is a relationship between wavelength and frequency. The formula is as follows: $$\text{speed}=\text{wavelength}\times\text{frequency}$$
    From now on though, I'm going to refer to these variables with letters: speed will be represented as $u$, wavelength represented as $\lambda$, and frequency represented as $v$. Therefore the above formula would be:  $$u=\lambda\times v$$
- Don't be intimidated by the symbols, just remember what they represent.

These properties of waves are especially important when using electromagnetic waves.

Electromagnetic waves are very important, because they're used in so many parts of our modern world. For example:
    - Microwaves use electromagnetic waves to heat our food.
    - These waves encode certain information that enables us to use wireless transmission. They allow us to connect to the Internet!
    - Among so many other things in science, such as medical inventions such as X-Rays, they make up visible light, which renowned physicist James Clerk Maxwell found out in 1873. (search him up, he has an AWESOME beard)

Now, I'm going to clear up a common misconception. The term "light" is often used colloquially as "visible light", but in the science world, all electromagnetic waves ARE light. This means that stuff like X-ray beams, microwave waves, those are all light too.

Now, this is an electromagnetic wave. ![](img/electromagneticwave.png)

As you saw in the picture, there are two waves: the electric field wave, and the magnetic field wave.
