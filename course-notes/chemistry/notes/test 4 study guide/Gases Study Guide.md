## Gas Laws
In gas problems, we take a container and fill it with some sort of gas. For example, during scuba diving, we fill a tank full of oxygen. The gas inside the container has a few properties. The main ones that we focus on in this unit are the following:
- Pressure
- Volume
- Temperature
- Moles
- Molar mass
    - NOT the same as moles
    - Example: Molar mass of O is 16
    - Example 2: Molar mass of $\ce{CO_2}$ is 44.01

All these variables are related with a variety of *gas laws*. Below are the important ones:

### Boyle's Law
(you like kissing boys dont you)
Given two gases that have the *same temperature and moles*, their pressures and volumes are related as follows: $$P_1V_1=P_2V_2$$
The above formula is the most important formula, but we can also write the relationship between pressure and volume like so: $$P\propto \frac{1}{V}$$
This says that pressure and volume are inversely related



Let's look at an example: 

> **Example 1:** There are two tanks of oxygen sitting on a table. The temperature and amount of gas (moles) in each container is the same. If the pressure of the first gas is 120 atm, the volume of the first gas is 60L, and the volume of the second gas is 30L, find the pressure of the second gas.

First we list our knowns. We know that: $P_1=120\text{ atm}$, $V_1=60\text{ L}$, and $V_2=30\text{ L}$.
Then, we want to find $P_2$. Rearrange the formula: $$P_2=\frac{P_1V_1}{V_2}=\frac{(120\text{ atm})(60\cancel{\text{ L}})}{30\cancel{\text{ L}}}=\boxed{240\text{ atm}}$$

### Charles's Law
Given two gases that have the *same pressure and moles*, their volumes and temperatures are related as follows: $$\frac{V_1}{T_1}=\frac{V_2}{T_2}$$
