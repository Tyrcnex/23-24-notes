To illustrate ionic and covalent bonds, I will tell the story of *Capitalism and Communism*.
### Capitalism
Our story starts in the land of Ionopoly. starts with two figures: slave **Nathan** and factory owner **Clement**. Nathan owns one talent; Clement owns seven. The main goal of any figure is to maintain stability and prosperity. This can be done if one obtains *eight talents*. 

Clement gives Nathan a deal. If Nathan gives Clement his talent, Clement will keep Nathan in stable conditions and promise to provide him with proper housing and care. The deal is agreed upon, and Clement now has 8 talents, while Nathan has none, but is guaranteed stability and housing from Clement. As such, they form a **bond**, where they are both stable and can prosper.

Here is a diagram to represent what happens.

### Communism
Of course, capitalism can only work under ideal conditions. Societal riots and the laborious hours in factory hours have led some to reconsider. Such was the case in the land of Covalentia.

To illustrate how their communistic system works, let us use an example.

Cyrus, Owen, and Olivia have some talents. Cyrus has 4, Owen has 6, and Olivia has 6. But alas, all of them want 8 talents. They agree on communistic terms:
- Cyrus and Owen will have something called a **sharing box**. This is where both parties will put the same amount of talents into the box and it will be counted as BOTH of their talents. For example, if Cyrus and Owen both put one talent into the box, Cyrus now has 3 of her own talents + 2 in the sharing box = 5 talents in total. At the same time, Owen now has 5 of his own talents + 2 in the sharing box = 7 talents in total.
- Cyrus and Olivia will also have a sharing box.

With the following terms, Cyrus puts 2 talents in each sharing box, while Owen and Olivia put in 2 talents into each of their respective sharing boxes. Here is the resulting diagram:



Now Cyrus has $4+4=8$ talents, Owen has $6+2=8$ talents, and Olivia has $6+2=8$ talents.

### The Bridge to Chemistry
##### Capitalism
The example shown in this section is an **ionic molecule**. If you didn't pick up on it, Nathan represents the symbol "Na", while Clement represents the symbol "Cl". Na has 1 valence electron, and Cl has 7. Cl has a tendency to "take" electrons, while Na has a tendency to "lose" electrons. By doing so, they form an **ionic bond** and are in a stable position.

Here is the diagram for the molecule NaCl:
##### Communism
The example shown in this section is a **covalent molecule**. Cyrus represents "C", while Owen and Olivia represent "O". C has 4 valence electrons and O has 6 valence electrons. When two atoms put a "talent", aka electron, into the "sharing box", that is a **covalent bond**.

There is a calculation to determine how many bonds there are. If you add up the total amount of *individual* valence electrons, you get $4+6+6=16$ electrons. At the end, they all want 8 valence electrons, so they will have $8\times3=24$ electrons at the end. Now, compute the following: $$\frac{24-16}{2}=4$$
Therefore there will be 4 bonds. Now it is a matter of trial and error. You can determine, from the example, that two of the bonds will be between the first O and C, and that two of the bonds will be between the second O and C, like so:
