	- Nuclear energy
- Materials and technology
	- Polymers, ceramics, liquid crystals
	- Room temperature superconductors?
	- Molecular computing?
- Food and agriculture
	- GMOs
	- Natural pesticides
	- Specialized fertilizers
- The study of chemistry
	- Macroscopic
	- Microscopic
		- Cannot see using the naked eye
			- Need a specific tool to see
			- Use simulations - 3D structures to study how they move
- The Scientific Method is a systematic approach to research
	- Observation - Representation - Interpretations
	- A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for a set of observations
		- Tested - modified (loop)
			- If your hypothesis doesn’t work, modify it.
- A law is a concise statement of a relationship between phenomena that is always the same under the same conditions.
- A theory is a unifying principle that explains a body of facts and/or those laws that are based on them
	- Difference is that law is proven, theory is not proven
	- We still use theory because it has been tested, it has a base, but it hasn’t been completed proven yet. Some parts of the theory still have to be explored.
		- If a fact that corresponds with a theory changes, then the theory might change too.
- Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes it undergoes
	- Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass.
	- A substance is a form of matter that has a definite composition and distinct properties
		- Even if there is an unknown “thing”, if you can identify its properties such as color, you can call it a substance
- A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in which the substances remain their distinct identities.
	- Homogenous mixture (solution) - The composition of the mixture is the same throughout (at the atomic/molecular level)
		- Usually, if you cannot differentiate the components, then it is homogenous.
	- Heterogeneous mixture - The composition is not uniform throughout.
		- Usually, if you can differentiate the components, then it is heterogeneous.
- Physical means can be used to separate a mixture into its pure components. It relies on the physical properties of the components. For example, distillation relies on the boiling point of the components.
- An element is a substance that cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means.
- A compound is a substance composed of atoms of two or more elements chemically united in fixed proportions.
	- Compounds can only be separated into their pure components by chemical means.
	- In chemical formula representations, generally, if there’s two or more capital letters, it is a compound; otherwise, it is an element.
- Alloy - a mixture that retains the properties of a metal
- The three states of matter:
	- Solid
		- Shape: constant
		- Volume: constant
		- Distance between particles: constant
		- Movement: not much
		- Compression: low
	- Liquid
		- Shape: variable
		- Volume: constant
		- Distance between particles: slightly variable
		- Movement: flow
		- Compression: medium
	- Gas
		- Shape: variable
		- Volume: variable
		- Distance between particles: variable
		- Movement: translate
		- Compression: high
- A physical change does not alter the composition or identity of a substance.
- A chemical change alters the composition or identity of the substance(s) involved.
- An extensive property of a material depends upon how much matter is being considered, for example, mass, length, volume.
- An intensive property of a material does not depend on how much matter is being considered, for example, density and color.
- Matter - anything that occupies space and has mass.
	- mass - measure of the quantity of matter
	- weight - force that gravity exerts on an object.
- Density = Mass / Volume
